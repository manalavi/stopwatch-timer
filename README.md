#### Stopwatch timer challenge

##### Learnings
1. Learned how to use useref with Javascript API calls and handle them.
2. already knew how to use useref with dom elements.
3. useRef doesnt allow the rerender to page screen / component. It persists the data as long as the reference exist. useRef and useState works contrary in some ways.
